# Strongest even within an interval

A strongness of an even number is the number of times we can successively divide by 2 until we reach an odd number 
starting with an even number n.

Given a closed interval [n, m], return the even number that is the strongest in the interval. If multiple solutions
exist return the smallest strongest even number.
